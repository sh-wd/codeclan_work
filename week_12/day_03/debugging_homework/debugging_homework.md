Answer the following questions:
1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
To assist in debugging a program.

2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
No, the program stops at the line of the breakpoint and doesn't execute that line or any after it.

3. How do we debug the next line of code?
We use the step over tool.

4. What does the step into command do?
It allows us to jump into a function that is being executed on the line of the breakpoint rather than step over to the next line of code.

5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
Evaluate expression allows you to evaluate a single expression whereas evaluate code fragment allows you to evaluate several lines of code at once.
